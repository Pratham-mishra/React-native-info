        <h1>About JSX</h1>
        <p>Engineers at Facebook, while working on designing the different complex Facebook apps,
            realized that the declarative style of coding would make their app organization easy.
            They developed a new programming language called JSX and a new mobile development
            framework called React Native to help build powerful and complex apps in an easy way.
            JSX combines both HTML and Javascript style of coding. JSX is declarative - we tell what are
            the different components we want in the application.</p>
            <h1>React Native</h1>
            <p>React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling
            developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="snack">
            <p> JSX and React Native code is generally written  in an online editor called 'snack'.
            <bold>'Snack'</bold> is an online editor written by Expo, which allows us to write and compile React
            Native code in an online environment. We can also preview the output of the code using
            Snack.</p>

            <h1>Components of React Native </h1>
            <h2>View</h2>
            <p>View is used to format the objects in the program as it contains the properties which can format the objects.Its properties are similar to that of the commands in CSS. In CSS we separate the commands usinf hypen '-' here the commands are written in camelcaseing </p>
            <h2> Text</h2>
            <p>Text is a component of React Native. It is used to define and format the texts. It has all the properties that view component has.</p>
            <h2>Button</h2>
            <p>Button is a component which used to define button in a program</p>
            <h1>Self-Component Creation</h1>
            <p>In JSX we can create our own components. We just have to create a class and extend it of Component and hence a new component is formed...</p>
            </div>

            <div class="coding">
            <h1>Coding of JSX</h1>
            <p>In JSX first import react component from react by writing
            import react,{component} from 'react'. Then, name the components 
            which we have to import ie.import{button,text,view} from 'react-native'
            In JSX there is a default which is app,which represents app as a whole
            .Every class has render(){} which allows us to write what should be displayed
             and return(); which allows us to write in its arguement what should be returned</p>
